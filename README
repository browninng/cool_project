Git Commands

git add - adds files to the repository so that Git knows to track their changes.
git commit - commits all added files to the repository as a change. With the -a flag, commits all changes to all tracked files. With the -m flag, allows you to specify a commit message directly on the command line instead of in your default editor.
git config - allows you to make configuration changes to Git. With the --global flag, makes these changes available across your entire system.
